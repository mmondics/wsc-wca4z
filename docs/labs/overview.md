# Lab Overview

In this lab you will explore four of the phases in the *IBM watsonx Code Assistant for Z* workflow.  The lab is performed on an instructor-provided image that you access through your web browser.  You do not need any additional software on your personal laptop or workstation other than a modern browser.

The phases you will explore are:

1. *Understand*
2. *Refactor*
3. *Transform*
4. *Validate*

Depending on your motivation for using *IBM watsonx Code Assistant for Z*, not all of the above phases are required. If you just need to gain a better understanding of your existing COBOL application estate, but do not wish to refactor your application into more modular business services, you might only perform the *Understand* phase.

If you are interested in creating modular COBOL business services but do not have an interest in Java, you will first perform the *Understand* phase in order to identify parts of your application to create modular services from, and then you will perform the *Refactor* phase in order to create these services.

If you are interested in converting parts of your COBOL application to Java, then after the *Understand* and *Refactor* phases you will perform the *Transform* and *Validate* phases.

The lab works with a sample COBOL application and gives an idea of what is involved in each phase.
